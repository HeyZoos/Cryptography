 Base64 is an encoding scheme that converts binary data into a text format using 64 ASCII characters, making it suitable for transferring data over media that only support text. When setting up conversions, it's useful to be able to look up the character using a [[Byte String Literal]].

```rust
b"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/"
```
