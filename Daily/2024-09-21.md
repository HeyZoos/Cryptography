- Need to have convenient ways to convert between encodings so you don't get bogged down hand-rolling converters
- Should get familiar with the `Iterator` API
- Re-learn the convenient byte manipulation tricks in EPI
- I would say being able to write basic cryptography algorithms under pressure depends on being comfortable with the encodings and byte manipulation tricks
- Get familiar with the `Range` API
- Why does `from_utf8` seem to automagically know to convert ASCII numbers to UTF8
